- 😎 Hello! I'm @dev-LuCamargo, and I'm currently focused on becoming a Front-End Developer;

- 👀 I'm interested in understanding and exploring the technologies that add value to HTML5 in the best possible way;

- 🌱 Such as:
✔Reactjs,

✔Next;

✔TypeScript;

✔Nodejs;

✔JavaScript, among others

- 💞️ I understand that every project must have its foundation based on the main rules that can be
- summarized in visual quality and clean coding for the project;

- 👍 Whether it's a simple project or not, the main thing is that it's responsive par excellence and
- that its production includes TAGS that contribute positively to the CEO together with search engines;

- I'm looking to collaborate in some way to the point of leaving my mark in this programming universe;

- 📫 How can I contact you? It's very simple, I have two emails:
dev.frontend.lucamargo@gmail.com or carreiradev.frontend.lc@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Relax, despite being in my sixties, I feel like I have a young mind and a child's soul.
- If you want to learn, produce, replicate, share, then you can call me by your name;

- ⚡ Curiosity, I have worked as a consultant, remote support and maintenance in the IT sector for over 20 years,
- but only about 2 years ago I decided to take a turn in my professional life, leaving my comfort zone in search
- of new challenges in this immense universe of programming/development.
